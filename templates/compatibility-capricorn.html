          <p class="article__text text-justify">You are mesmerized, aren’t you? No wonder, because Taurus’ Sun is in the section corresponding to real, unconditioned love. Taurus is prudent, reliable, practical - all the qualities that you are looking for in a partner. You, dear Capricorn, have a very realistic vision on marriage, that’s why you are very aware of the importance of the mutual trust. 

</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Family and home are very important to both of you. Taurus seldom goes off the right way; (s)he sees faithfulness as a way of respecting the other, but him/herself, too. That is not to say that you are in for a dull life. Taurus knows how to keep the marital harmony. Sexually, you are on the same wavelength: cerebral and patient, a quality that is often highly appreciated in specialized treatises. Taurus is full of charm (and not only) until old aged because the planet governing him/her is Venus, the star of beauty and sensuality.</p>

          <p class="article__text text-justify">Virgo is the partner that won’t ask you why you have to work so much, because any Virgo is devoted to career. You are two Earth people, so you react very quickly to what is practical. You will even have to make a pact so you don’t forget the pleasures of intimacy. Doesn’t a hot night ring a bell? Leave the office for a minute!
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Virgo’s prototype is the cosmic librarian, with her hair done up, in a rope probably, and a pair of glasses well set on her nose. Don’t set yourself a trap: the native Virgo can be the sexiest person on Earth!Your Virgo has excellent communication abilities and (s)he also knows the body language. Why should you be interested in that? Because you can enjoy extremely sensual moments!

          <p class="article__text text-justify">We are dealing with a sensational couple! You, dear Capricorn, lay the solid foundation and Scorpio will fill everything with passion and stability. Scorpio’s extreme emotions, his/her passions - among which the passion (s)he has for you - fascinates you. Scorpio’s water and Capricorn’s earth will result in excellent clay!</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Scorpio is endowed with great shrewdness and it will bring you wealth, if combined with your financial ability. There is a problem though: your Scorpio likes spending the money that you save by working hard. If you want to stop him/her, you can only marry him/her.Scorpio is very hardworking and can make great efforts when (s)he puts his/her mind on something. In a Capricorn-Scorpio relationship, you will be more flexible than the usual: you will soon realize that it is impossible to talk to a Scorpio about something else than what (s)he is concerned about.</p>

          <p class="article__text text-justify">This combination between Earth and Water can be fundamental to a really extraordinary relationship! By knowing your Pisces intimately, you will come to understand his/her deepest desires.You are not a person that lacks ideas, dear Capricorn, but yours are always reality-oriented. On the other side, Pisces seems to be made of dreams and emotions only, apparently at least. You are right, in a way, but where do you go wrong? In characterizing Pisces’ intuition as “irrational”. 

</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">You will be surprised to see that (s)he hardly ever makes a mistake! Pisces will tell you about premonitions, prophetic dreams and ideas that have no real base. Although it seems very strange, you will find out that (s)he is almost always right.What you cannot understand is Pisces’ lack of materialism. Not only does (s)he see things differently from you, but from all the other people, too. Your ambition is to buy a new car or an expensive jewelry, but when you tell Pisces about things like these, (s)he just looks at you and says with no enthusiasm: “Ok, if you want to.”

          <p class="article__text text-justify">Your Cancer lover was born six months away in the zodiac, so you will find him/her either complementary or at the other end of your values. In brief, a Capricorn-Cancer union will bring you either perfection, or complete confusion. The final result depends on you. Let’s take a look at the pros and cons.
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Capricorn governs the section of the horoscope that is responsible for honours and fame, therefore you are very ambitious and you hope to come to a leading position. You do very well in large corporations, as well as in politics. You know what hierarchical relations are about and you even like them. You are rigorous, that’s why the institutions with well defined responsibilities seem very productive to you. You were born under an Earth sign so you are very pragmatic. Enters Cancer! Let’s welcome him/her properly, ladies and gentlemen! First of all, Cancer is a Water sign, very different from you. Cancer governs home and family. Although (s)he works hard, Cancer is not willing to make the same individual effort as you are, dear Capricorn. Still, we are in front of a funny couple, because Cancer will feed you and your children, offering you the lifestyle you aspire to, and you have no idea what you should do in exchange!

          <p class="article__text text-justify">Could two goats like yourselves experience true love? You have all the chances in the world! The only problem is that you are both too busy, for which reason you can make love only on your way to work or during your short lunch break. No matter how much you love each other, how much burning passion you have for each other, somewhere, deep in your heart, career comes first and so does the need of social recognition. Precisely because you know what this desire means, you will understand your Capricorn lover and stand by him/her, regardless of the sacrifices!</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">The problem with this relation is that you are both more interested in the social and professional success than in the marital one. You are much too serious and the relation is in danger of becoming rather caustic.</p>

          <p class="article__text text-justify">It cannot be a classical couple, because Gemini is much more desirous of excitement than you are, dear Capricorn. Most certainly, you walked into the trap of his/her sharp and resourceful mind. I’m sure that’s what attracted you from the beginning.Gemini can make you lose your head in a minute, because you take things seriously too quickly, things that (s)he is just playing with. Gemini is not a possessive person. (S)He is rather busy, so you shouldn’t worry if you run late at the office. 

</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Gemini will ask all kinds of questions about yourself, which will inevitably scare you and make you wonder: “If I tell him/her everything, won’t (s)he get tired of me soon?” You could be right...

          <p class="article__text text-justify">From the astrological point of view, a Capricorn-Leo relationship is doomed to failure, because you, dear Capricorn, are an Earth sign and Leo is a Fire sign. Usually, the Earth does not tolerate the Fire elements, but if you take a close look at how much you have in common, you will be very surprised. In my opinion, this relationship has many chances to work. 
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">You are both crazy about an active social life, but the Lion is more exuberant and openhearted while you are more reserved. Social relations are very important to both of you, but for different reasons: one of you wants to enjoy him/herself, the other wants to “extend” his/her influence. You probably recognized yourself in the latter. </p>

          <p class="article__text text-justify">This is a difficult couple, indeed. Let’s say you are complementary, but only to give you some hope. One of the main problems is that of the planets governing you: Capricorn is governed by Saturn and Sagittarius is governed by Jupiter. Sagittarius is optimistic and friendly, while you, dear Capricorn, are strict and realistic. Consequently, (s)he will reproach you with your pessimism. 
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Don’t hope that your beloved Sagittarius will ever understand the expression “to save up for a rainy day”. As far as you are concerned, his/her joyfulness and spirit of adventure can make you classify him/her as “irresponsible”. Physically, Sagittarius likes practicing, that’s why (s)he may be very skilful and (s)he may laugh in your face, making jokes about how... clumsy you are! This will make you mad and determine you to do only what you want to - or you won’t feel like doing anything anymore unless you are advised by your partner.

          <p class="article__text text-justify">Do opposites attract each other? Yes, they do, quite often. Can they hold on together? Sometimes - but in the Capricorn-Aquarius case, the differences are too big. The result of this combination depends on the difference between your expectations and the outcome.Do Aquarius’s unconventional ideas and his/her need of strong sensations send shivers up your spine? You may think these are exciting and provoking qualities, but only in the beginning. You, dear Capricorn, are a traditional to the backbone, while Aquarius does not care about social status, as you do. (S)He doesn’t mind shocking, revolutionizing - on the contrary! </p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Even if your Aquarius is not a typical one, (s)he still has a colder temperament than yours. His/Her vision of the world is very objective. (S)He doesn’t let feelings get in the way of reason. Sometimes, his/her interests can be so very modern and “flexible”, that you will be longing for a more stabile and... loving person.

          <p class="article__text text-justify">What is there ahead of you? A bumpy road. Each of you will appreciate it differently because you have differently oriented senses of space direction. Considering the belief that love overcomes any obstacle, let’s take a look at this combination. Capricorn’s traditional spirit suits perfectly with working in an organization. You think that authority relations are fair and you feel very well in an institutionalized environment. Try talking to Aries about bosses, though. I wouldn’t advise you to, because (s)he is his/her own boss.

          <p class="article__text text-justify">Moreover, the desire for freedom and the spirit of adventure that characterize Aries can annoy you terribly. You aspire to stability but (s)he does not have such dreams. If you live together, agitation will come into your house, too.

          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Capricorn-Libra Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Because your Suns are in a fight position, we cannot talk about a classical astrological combination, but you could make it work since there are some things you have in common. You both have very busy schedules. Although you are very energetic, socially, Libra will be even more involved than you will! Can you believe that? (S)He knows almost all people in the world and thus you will have the chance to meet wonderful people through him/her. Since you are a Capricorn and you want to have many connections, you will be very pleased with this opportunity. Your beloved Libra is the quintessence of diplomacy and charm, qualities that you will cherish especially if (s)he joins you for a business meeting. </p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Both Capricorn and Libra are cardinal signs, that’s why you are both keen on challenge. Venus, the planet that governs Libra, shows us that these natives possess a power that manifests with subtlety. Due to the way (s)he takes advantage of his/her natural charm, Libra is thought of as the power behind the throne.</p>
