          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Virgo-Taurus Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Your rationality goes with Taurus’ fierce, though gentle insistence very well. Moreover, Taurus is diligent and hardworking and (s)he will always agree with you on the practical issues. Taurus doesn’t mind your criticism because (s)he is a good analyst.

</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">But Taurus is also rather impulsive and (s)he often sees red with anger... Although (s)he gets over it very quickly, the sensitive Virgo could feel hurt at these outbursts.

          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Virgo-Cancer Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Cancer is not a very dominant sign, which suits Virgo perfectly. Moreover, Cancer is good at presents and little surprises, which suits Virgo even better because Virgo likes feeling appreciated, loved and safe. Cancer is jealous and possessive enough to make you feel important, and sentimental enough to make you feel comfortable in this relationship.
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Saving to almost being thrifty, your Cancer matches with your financial style very well and you won’t be worried about useless expenses; moreover, Cancer will appreciate your concern about future.</p>

          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Virgo-Scorpio Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">You complete each other that well that this combination could become mystical. Of course, nothing is forever certain with a Scorpio, but you, dear Virgo, will know how to go beyond the well-built shell and open Scorpio’s complicated soul. Just like you, Scorpio knows what his/her flaws and qualities are and (s)he is willing to listen to your criticism (finally, someone who doesn’t get angry or upset when it comes to Virgo’s perfectionism).
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Scorpio is a very possessive person, which you might find stressful sometimes, especially at the beginning of the relation because you need time to analyze things and assess them carefully. On the other hand, Scorpio is very generous and faithful once (s)he has become yours. And since Virgo takes into consideration the cerebral part of love and even excites better when (s)he is certain of the partner’s commitment, it will bring you closer.</p>

          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Virgo-Capricorn Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">That is twice Earth, what could go wrong? Two Earth signs like you should get along wonderfully, according to all known and unknown standards of astrology. That’s about all the good news I had.
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Let’s be honest: any Virgo in this world is a perfectionist. Not “a little perfectionist”, not “somewhat perfectionist”. But completely perfectionist. Capricorn often feels the same thing. The problems start when everything is filtered through the complicated mind of a Capricorn. Although Capricorn is an Earth sign, (s)he is not very earthly. And not as serious as (s)he is supposed to be, either.</p>

          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Virgo-Virgo Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">The relations between natives of the same sun sign are sometimes rather strange. But things seem to work just fine between two Virgos. It often happens that one of you is the atypical Virgo and the other is the “classical”, the more obedient Virgo. Your relation can be interesting and exciting as long as the two perfectionists of the zodiac refrain from finding flaws and criticizing all the time (it’s for the good of the other, we know that, but still...).
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">You both are responsible people and spending too much on trifles doesn’t even cross your mind. You both enjoy talking, analyzing and dissecting everything, and I pity your poor neighbours (it’s called gossip around here, but there is nothing wrong with it, as long as you remember that nobody is perfect).</p>

      <article class="article article-pisces text article--single">
          <div class="article__icon text-center"><svg width="64" height="64"><use xlink:href="{{static_url("images/sprite.svg")}}#icon-smile" /></svg></div>
          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Virgo-Pisces Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">To you, dear Virgo, love means safety and intellectual and spiritual compatibility. Even the physical contact has to show compatibility. To Pisces, love is something like a torrent, a waterfall, huge waves, something that is the centre of everything. Indeed, the attraction will probably be magnetical at first (you know, the opposites...), but the laws of physics don’t always work in astrology and the attraction will soon disappear when you see how different from each other you are. The main problem you two have? Pisces doesn’t really know what side of reality (s)he is swimming in.
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">The good news? Pisces gets along well with almost anybody, for Pisces is a very sympathetic sign. But... You know what you want very well and you also know how to ask for it (insistently). Pisces always has some music in his/her mind and (s)he simply cannot pay attention ONLY to what you say, for your your Pisces has other rhythms to listen to and (s)he lives to them. As a Water sign, Pisces is emotional, sentimental, and (s)he has his/her head in the clouds. And this is too much for a sensible, tidy and realistic Virgo!</p>

          <div class="article__icon text-center"><svg width="64" height="64"><use xlink:href="{{static_url("images/sprite.svg")}}#icon-smile" /></svg></div>
          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Virgo-Aries Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Indeed, Aries is the smartest, the most courageous, the most ... Aries fascinated you from the beginning. No wonder, that’s what an Aries knows best, to fascinate while changing the world! (S)He has the craziest ideas, (s)he dresses very well, (s)he has style and everything, (s)he needs to be royal, and all because (s)he’s an Aries.
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">It’s understandable that you fell in love with an Aries. This sunsign has many of the qualities you appreciate the most. But think of all the flaws that get on your nerves! Every time you want to discuss, plan and think a little more, your Aries goes headfirst into the action. Aries is a sign that prefers doing rather than talking. Aries is too impulsive for Virgo’s Earthly calm. Aries is Fire, isn’t (s)he?

          <div class="article__icon text-center"><svg width="64" height="64"><use xlink:href="{{static_url("images/sprite.svg")}}#icon-smile" /></svg></div>
          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Virgo-Leo Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Very briefly: Leo is a very passionate native and you, dear Virgo, are not. Leo takes it personally. Virgo’s reserved nature and passive attitude towards life annoys / frustrates / gets on Leo’s nerves and leads to arguments.By the way, let’s not forget that Virgo is not quite the most appropriate court poet, (s)he is not good at praising, on the contrary, you are a little critic, while Leo breathes and lives on praise. Moreover, Leo spends very much while you are economical.</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Leo has a way of dominating and giving orders (that means Leo doesn’t add “please” or “if you want to” at the end of an imperative sentence), which drives you to despair. Shortly, it’s a relation that lasts a little more than the lifespan of a butterfly.</p>

          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Virgo-Libra Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">If you fell in love with a Libra, that means you are willing, as a Virgo, to make some serious efforts to have more fun, to put seriousness aside and socialize more.Virgo and Libra couldn’t be more different from each other... While Libra always finds a way of cutting down the amount of work, Virgo takes his/her job very seriously, sometimes too seriously. Of course, from a temperate Virgo’s point of view, that is sheer shallowness.
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Libra likes spending, going to parties (or being among people, anyway) and being in the spotlight. Virgo starts criticizing, and Libra feels hurt. Then, Virgo tries to dominate and change Libra’s nature that seems too wild to him/her. And Libra gets upset. You, dear Virgo, are a reserved, practical person that keeps his/her feet on the ground, and Libra will take it as a frontal attack.

          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Virgo-Aquarius Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Virgo stands up, goes to the kitchen, opens the cupboard, takes a glass, fills it, drinks it and comes back.</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Aquarius stands up, goes to the kitchen, on his/her way (s)he arranges the children’s slippers, dusts a shelf, gets into the kitchen, opens the cupboard, sees the jar of jam and thinks (s)he feels like some pancakes, takes the jar and a teaspoon, eats, puts the jar in the fridge (for (s)he has already forgotten where (s)he took the jar from), there (s)he sees the mayonnaise that should be on a different shelf and (s)he takes it out to think where (s)he should put it, but (s)he forgets about it and leaves it there; then (s)he realizes that yesterday’s leftovers should be put in a smaller pan and (s)he gets down to making the switch, then (s)he remembers to look for something else in the closet and comes back to the sitting room (the kitchen already looks as if a war took place there). “It took you quite some time to drink a glass of water...”, Virgo tells him/her. “Water? What water? Oh, I’ll go drink some”...

          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Virgo-Gemini Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">What is it that attracted you to each other? Maybe it was your common interest in intellectual, cultural, philosophical issues or the fact that both Virgo and Gemini have an active and curious mind. But the Twins are too instable and too impulsive to satisfy a good, tidy, economical Virgo. Not to mention that Gemini spends as if the Apocalypse were coming the next day and is always talking on the phone.</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Even if your Gemini is attractive, beautiful and has that young appearance (they all have it, they behave like teenagers even when they are old), after the first passion fades away, there will be few common things left to share.

          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Virgo-Sagittarius Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">The ant and the cricket! The philosophical question is whether these two creatures, each of them noble in his/her own way (notice to the Virgo ants: it’s not easy to discuss philosophy all day long!) can get along, and for how long.
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">In a nutshell? Your utilities are three months overdue but you could go to the seaside with that money. Tough choice... Virgo pays the utilities, Sagittarius goes to the seaside.A Virgo would be better off by him/herself! It’s understandable that Sagittarius is called the sign of bachelors (not of spinsters, though). It’s true that if you have some well placed planets, you could get along. For a while.
