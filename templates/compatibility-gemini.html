          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Gemini-Aries Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Your Aries is under the sign of Mars or, better said, (s)he is on the move all the time because if you say Mars, you actually say fast actions. And Aries will truly feel perfect next to a restless Gemini like you. Your intellectual and speculative side will amaze Aries, but, to be honest, whom wouldn’t an Aries in action amaze? You will have problems, too, because neither of you is too tranquil, but your Air feeds Aries’ Fire. That means (s)he will love you like crazy!
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">What attracted you to an Aries? Let’s see: was it the overwhelming energy and enthusiasm that could change the world? The passion Aries invests in everything (s)he does? Or was it the easiness with which Aries comes up with ideas? Aries gets bored very easily. So do you. So you can conquer, rebuild, rearrange the world together, because Gemini is curious by nature and Aries is a born “innovator”.

          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Gemini-Leo Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Leo is very inflexible, and you are flexibility itself. Leo has deep-rooted ideas, fixed concepts, is stubborn and very often (s)he just has to have it his/her way! Do you expect the freedom you need so much from a Leo? Change your mind because Leo wants you chained besides him/her (in a great, theatrical love because Leo has a generous heart and a rare theatrical sense, but it is still called chaining).

</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">In the beginning, you will probably be attracted to Leo’s passion for everything that is glamorous and elegant: (s)he likes going out and having high-quality things (from champagne and caviar to the best car), and when it comes to paying court, Leo is the master of it!

          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Gemini-Libra Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Air and Air... Does it work? Of course it does, the only problem is precisely that nobody really “stays” in such a relationship!
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">A Gemini-Libra relationship is beautiful, often full of satisfactions, because each of you understands the other intuitively - after all, both of you are Air signs. Your Libra is intellectual, refined, honest and optimistic. Just like you, dear Gemini, Libra loves discussing and debating and has the same inner fire that makes him/her wander all the time, visiting cities, friends, anything.

          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Gemini-Aquarius Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Here is, at last, someone who can live up to your bright intellect! Aquarius is a fixed sign so (s)he will bring some stability to your sometimes chaotic life. Your high sensitiveness will make you fall in love with Aquarius’ unlimited fantasy.
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">If I were to characterize the Gemini-Aquarius relation in two words, they would be “passion” and “carelessness”. You both live in the present, have lots of ideas and like talking about everything. Aquarius is very inventive, very attached sentimentally to someone that gained his/her esteem, and Gemini - with his/her intellectual and spiritual charm and his/her eternal youth - will be the perfect choice for an Aquarius.

          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Gemini-Gemini Compatibility</h2>Two Gemini people in the same place... the world will look different every morning. You will probably go to all the pubs and all your friends, you will understand each other intuitively, like two spring winds that meet and wander in the sky. Home? What’s that? You will probably spend so little time at home that you will forget where you keep your forks...

</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Whoever invented the expression “love at first sight” must have thought of two people of the same sun sign! However, it remains to be seen if love at first sight means eternal love.

          <p class="article__text text-justify">Air and adventurous Fire... You almost embody the saying about the opposites that attract each other... It will be either everything or nothing - because you are six months away from each other in the zodiac and generally, these relations are either heaven or hell. The good thing is that you will realize what your situation is very quickly.
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">The sparkling intellect of the philosopher of the zodiac (Sagittarius), his/her ideas, his/her ingenious mind and his/her questions about life, religion and society - all this fascinated you, of course. This relation begins impulsively, but requires effort from both of you in order to resist!

          <p class="article__text text-justify">spring wind and conservative Water? Enumerate 20 qualities that you appreciate about Cancer, quickly! If you have found them, you are lucky, your Crab has some planets that help him/her be on the same wavelength with you, but that doesn’t mean that your relation will be easy, not even for a moment.
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">The adolescent of the zodiac, that’s what they call you, and adolescents live intensely, think that the world belongs to them, but they seldom reach depth of feelings... Well, it is somewhere in that depth that you can find the Cancer, who is a Water sign, highly sensitive and very warm, but not willing to accept as many waves as you create by your mere presence!

          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Gemini-Taurus Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Each sign of the zodiac has the qualities that the preceding sign lacks... Gemini is right after Taurus so they aren’t very careful when they throw themselves into a project, don’t count ten times before cutting (in fact, they don’t even count) and they know that dreams and occasions disappear when you take too much time to decide... The Gemini native takes risks, is sharp-minded, witty in conversations, very versatile and changing and has a unique gift for communication! Gemini is the best at it... You need roots though, considered risks, safe methods and caution in everything.
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Gemini can live in a suitcase, that’s how much (s)he feels the need to travel, to walk, to go to friends’ houses, exhibitions, dinner-parties, anywhere, but not home. And this is exactly what you want most: to be able to stay at home, next to someone, in a comfortable home away from the crazy world.

          <p class="article__text text-justify">bright Air and deep, mysterious and possessive Water... Hardly could such a relation last if it is based on physical attraction only.
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Let’s start with the good things: Scorpio is passionate, and this will fascinate you. You were probably attracted to the fire that burns in his/her eyes, and it is understandable. It is said that this sign takes passion to obsession...

          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Gemini-Capricorn Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Air and Earth. They don’t really mix... Capricorn likes working, is ambitious and knows exactly what (s)he wants. So be careful, dear Gemini, Capricorn is not very keen on your ever changing style...
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">The good news is that a Capricorn is rational enough and has his/her feet on the ground so (s)he will get your attention. Another advantage is that a Capricorn seems to get younger as time passes. But Capricorn has a lot of “cardinal” energy, is governed by Saturn (a planet that teaches us life lessons) and is often pessimistic, expecting that his/her love is not shared: Capricorn was betrayed so many times that (s)he is now more than careful.

          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Gemini Virgo Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Ok, you are not a classical astrological couple at all, Air and Earth don’t mix... BUT! If you really want a relationship with somebody that different (why not, after all?), don’t forget that both Gemini and Virgo are governed by Mercury, that is the representation of Hermes, the one who used to take Gods’ messages. Talk to your Virgo, communicate, it is your strong point anyway, and this can make any relationship work.
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">It’s true that Mercury involves in each of your sun signs directly: Gemini’s Mercury deals with communication and Virgo’s, with thinking. The fact that you both have it as governor of your sun signs will help you a lot, but you will still have to make some efforts.

          <p class="article__text text-justify">Air and mystical Water? Difficult, very difficult, and I’m not even sure it is worth trying for you.
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">You were probably attracted to Pisces’ mysterious appearance, strange attitude, something that you cannot define. Yes, this is Pisces. Symbolized by two fish that swim in opposite directions, Pisces is often driven by contradictory desires (that means (s)he doesn’t know what (s)he wants or what (s)he is heading to!)
