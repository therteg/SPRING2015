          <p class="article__text text-justify">Your Aries is under the sign of Mars or, better said, (s)he is on the move all the time because if you say Mars, you actually say fast actions. And Aries will truly feel perfect next to a restless Gemini like you. Your intellectual and speculative side will amaze Aries, but, to be honest, whom wouldn’t an Aries in action amaze? You will have problems, too, because neither of you is too tranquil, but your Air feeds Aries’ Fire. That means (s)he will love you like crazy!
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">What attracted you to an Aries? Let’s see: was it the overwhelming energy and enthusiasm that could change the world? The passion Aries invests in everything (s)he does? Or was it the easiness with which Aries comes up with ideas? Aries gets bored very easily. So do you. So you can conquer, rebuild, rearrange the world together, because Gemini is curious by nature and Aries is a born “innovator”.

          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Gemini-Leo Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Leo is very inflexible, and you are flexibility itself. Leo has deep-rooted ideas, fixed concepts, is stubborn and very often (s)he just has to have it his/her way! Do you expect the freedom you need so much from a Leo? Change your mind because Leo wants you chained besides him/her (in a great, theatrical love because Leo has a generous heart and a rare theatrical sense, but it is still called chaining).

</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">In the beginning, you will probably be attracted to Leo’s passion for everything that is glamorous and elegant: (s)he likes going out and having high-quality things (from champagne and caviar to the best car), and when it comes to paying court, Leo is the master of it!

          <p class="article__text text-justify">Air and Air... Does it work? Of course it does, the only problem is precisely that nobody really “stays” in such a relationship!
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">A Gemini-Libra relationship is beautiful, often full of satisfactions, because each of you understands the other intuitively - after all, both of you are Air signs. Your Libra is intellectual, refined, honest and optimistic. Just like you, dear Gemini, Libra loves discussing and debating and has the same inner fire that makes him/her wander all the time, visiting cities, friends, anything.

          <p class="article__text text-justify">Here is, at last, someone who can live up to your bright intellect! Aquarius is a fixed sign so (s)he will bring some stability to your sometimes chaotic life. Your high sensitiveness will make you fall in love with Aquarius’ unlimited fantasy.
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">If I were to characterize the Gemini-Aquarius relation in two words, they would be “passion” and “carelessness”. You both live in the present, have lots of ideas and like talking about everything. Aquarius is very inventive, very attached sentimentally to someone that gained his/her esteem, and Gemini - with his/her intellectual and spiritual charm and his/her eternal youth - will be the perfect choice for an Aquarius.

You will probably spend so little time at home that you will forget where you keep your forks...

</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Whoever invented the expression “love at first sight” must have thought of two people of the same sun sign! However, it remains to be seen if love at first sight means eternal love.

The good thing is that you will realize what your situation is very quickly.
</p>

          <p class="article__text text-justify">Each sign of the zodiac has the qualities that the preceding sign lacks... Gemini is right after Taurus so they aren’t very careful when they throw themselves into a project, don’t count ten times before cutting (in fact, they don’t even count) and they know that dreams and occasions disappear when you take too much time to decide... The Gemini native takes risks, is sharp-minded, witty in conversations, very versatile and changing and has a unique gift for communication! Gemini is the best at it... You need roots though, considered risks, safe methods and caution in everything.
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Gemini can live in a suitcase, that’s how much (s)he feels the need to travel, to walk, to go to friends’ houses, exhibitions, dinner-parties, anywhere, but not home. And this is exactly what you want most: to be able to stay at home, next to someone, in a comfortable home away from the crazy world.

</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">The good news is that a Capricorn is rational enough and has his/her feet on the ground so (s)he will get your attention. Another advantage is that a Capricorn seems to get younger as time passes. But Capricorn has a lot of “cardinal” energy, is governed by Saturn (a planet that teaches us life lessons) and is often pessimistic, expecting that his/her love is not shared: Capricorn was betrayed so many times that (s)he is now more than careful.

If you really want a relationship with somebody that different (why not, after all?), don’t forget that both Gemini and Virgo are governed by Mercury, that is the representation of Hermes, the one who used to take Gods’ messages. Talk to your Virgo, communicate, it is your strong point anyway, and this can make any relationship work.
</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">It’s true that Mercury involves in each of your sun signs directly: Gemini’s Mercury deals with communication and Virgo’s, with thinking. The fact that you both have it as governor of your sun signs will help you a lot, but you will still have to make some efforts.
