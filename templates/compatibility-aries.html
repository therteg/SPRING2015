          <p class="article__text text-justify">Aries people have deep-rooted opinions and are very stubborn. Your purpose in the zodiac is to represent the force of life, the energy. “I” is the most important word in the vocabulary
of an Aries. Therefore, the combination between two Aries people could become one
of those spicy things - in plain English, a troubled love.</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">If each of you succeeds in going beyond his/her stubbornness and desire to be the one
who’s always right, and if you give up the inevitable fights for power, you could have a beautiful relation, active, imaginative and resourceful.</p>

          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Aries-Taurus Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Have you fallen in love with a Taurus? Do you happen to like stability? Taurus is very different
from you: (s)he keeps his/her feet on the ground, (s)he likes safety, risks scare him/
her to death, change is an earthquake to him/her. Not to say that Taurus does not have
your strong nerves and this could lead to many conflicts!</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">The main disadvantage for an Aries in getting involved with a Taurus lies in the fact that
(s)he is really, really slow in everything (s)he does. Not in the bad meaning of the word,
only Taurus is more prudent, more difficult to start, more sensual when making love, or
slower in making decisions. I don’t have to tell you how much this thing will annoy you,
because Aries lives and moves at top speed. I think you are already guessing.</p>

          <p class="article__text text-justify">Gemini people have enough charm to share it with other people and they are so captivating
that you could be hypnotized. You both like thrilling life and you both get bored easily.
You both have a dexterity one could envy and you are both agile. For both Aries and Gemini
communication is so important that you will always have a lot of friends and activities,
a tireless and forever exciting life. You do everything together, from having ardent philosophical
debates to drawing up detailed layouts, and you couldn’t complete each other better.
You might be in lack of money, rest or whatever, but you will never be short of ideas.</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Gemini will make you known like no other, because nobody is better than Gemini is at
spreading the word. Fortunately for you, Gemini people are flexible so (s)he does not need
leadership (the thing that gnaws at your heart) and will happily take the road you chose.</p>

          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Aries-Cancer Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">When you try to explain to him/her that you want to do something great for the human
kind, money or friends, (s)he will just ask you why you can’t have a regular job like all
the others, be someone’s subordinate. Because an Aries, even when (s)he is employed in a
company, will still cook up secret plans to become independent: you are the world’s enterprisers.
You will probably try anything to reach this goal, as if you escaped from a prison.
And Cancer will ask you why you don’t spend more time at home! That’s nerve, isn’t it?
Cancer doesn’t have your unlimited ambition so (s)he will accept the Aries’s explanations,
but still, (s)he will never understand how work can be more important than family.</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">If you succeed in getting over it and over the Cancer’s caprices (it’s a very changing and
moody sun sign, both as far as men and women are concerned), the Crab will offer you a
dream-like family life, because here (s)he feels fulfilled.</p>

          <p class="article__text text-justify">The Lion has a great heart that will fascinate you, and an inclination towards theatricalism
that will always make you laugh (what Aries wouldn’t yield to this strong argument?)
You are both Fire signs, so you will always discover new things together, you will create or
initiate projects. You want the same things, so you will get them much easier together. Leo
is a very romantic sign - (s)he symbolizes the celestial man’s heart - so your Leo will have
many, many adorable surprises for you.</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Get ready to go to the most famous restaurants because Leo likes going out, showing him/
herself, frequenting refined and elegant places. Leo also likes being dressed-up and manages
to look good no matter what (s)he is wearing, so you’d better put on your best clothes
and give up jeans and T-shirts, dear Aries.</p>

          <p class="article__text text-justify">Virgo is meticulous, hardworking (like you), but you have very different ways of expressing
yourselves and perceive the world. Virgo gets up in the morning and knows exactly
what (s)he will be doing at 9:15 am or 3:30 pm, and if (s)he doesn’t finish his/her work, (s)
he is just like a toy with a key, (s)he keeps spinning until (s)he gets where (s)he wants to.
Virgo doesn’t need a boss to push him/her from behind: his/her ambition is enough.</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">There is no such thing like a Virgo not helping his/her friends or not keeping his/her
word. One could say that this is the purpose of Virgo’s life. You, dear Aries, have the overall
view, more courage and you are better at relations and connections. Virgo takes great
pleasure in details and organization. Next to a Virgo, if you succeed in changing that much
so that your relationship works, you will become stronger and you will have more chances
for your dreams to come true (Fire initiates projects, but Earth maintains them).</p>

          <p class="article__text text-justify">A born diplomat, loving beauty and showing the gentleness characteristic of the love symbolized
by his/her tutorial planet (Venus), Libra is good at making long-term plans and contracts. To an
Aries, this is an essential quality, because the native of this sign is a very good initiator, but not
very efficient in carrying out plans.</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">A very communicative Air sign, Libra will always encourage you with new ideas and will show
you new points of view to interpret things from. Libra likes team work - Libra is, in fact, the sign
of marriage - so Libra will always look for a middle way, for a right solution to problems - that’s
an warning for the Aries people that are bossy and tyrannical.</p>

force of life.</p>
