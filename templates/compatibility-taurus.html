Their sound, isolated inner worlds are frequently storming with perpetual force. Most Scorpio natives are questioning and possessive, and they can’t digest treachery or the slightest hint of no, in their stride. The Scorpio sting is widely known, and even the most diplomatic Scorpio will fall prey to one of his/ her extreme, vindictive moods.

          <p class="article__text text-justify">Earth and overwhelming Water? Yes, you’ve found the
right partner. You both want the same things: a family, a home, stability, safety... You are
both sensual, and Cancer’s almost telepathic powers will guess your wishes before they are
uttered. Your Cancer will take care of you, will offer you a harmonious home... how could
such a relationship not work?</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Money means very much to both Taurus and Cancer natives, so you can afford to spend
and you can count on Cancer’s being aware of the fact that (s)he has to work for his/her
family, as much as you are aware of it. Cancer is a little thrifty, even thriftier than you are,
dear Taurus, so you’ll be the one spending more.</p>

          <p class="article__text text-justify">Taurus and Virgo are both Earth signs, consequently you both want the same things:
much money and free time for cultural activities. The Virgins are the highly cautious ones
(What if...?), and Taurus is the “soul curer” of the zodiac, so you are a perfect match.</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Virgo has so many fears and worries because (s)he has a keen sense of responsibility, of
duty. Virgo is afraid (s)he’ll disappoint the people around him/her, friends, bosses, neighbors...
You, dear Taurus, are as perseverant as Virgo is, but you don’t worry that much and,
besides that, you like giving advice and comforting people, so you’ve found your pair in a
Virgo...</p>

          <h2 class="article__header text-center">Taurus-Capricorn Compatibility</h2>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">First of all, Capricorn inspires you, because he is not the man/woman to stay down the
valley - the goat has to climb up the hills and the rocks to be at ease: (s)he is ambitious
and persevering. It is at the top of the mountain that the Capricorn feels good and (s)he
has enough patience and tenacity to reach his/her goals. Capricorn is very hardworking.
When (s)he gets down to work, (s)he commits himself to it and gives his best.</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Just like you, Capricorn knows how to deal with money and especially what to do with
it, so you won’t be in danger regarding the domestic resources. Your life together will be
harmonious because you both know from your own experience what the other wants or
needs.</p>

          <p class="article__text text-justify">For a Taurus, Pisces is indeed a perfect match, with his/her weird poetry, with the sensitiveness,
understanding and spirit of sacrifice that characterize this native governed by
Neptune, the dream and mysticism giver.</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Pisces will teach you the subtlety of living life at an artistic level, the altruism, and you
could take him/her out sometimes, help your Pisces trust him/herself and especially give
him/her a material base (Pisces are not into money and don’t care about these earthly matters),
teach him/her how to administer money and not to allow the others to take advantage
of him/her.</p>

          <p class="article__text text-justify">You like being able to trust a partner - and you can certainly trust a Taurus like you! Taurus
likes taking the time to show his/her feelings and since you are both so sensual, so
fond of touching (your sense of shapes is very keen), you’ll surely have dream moments
together.</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Taurus is governed by Venus, so you both like elegant, qualitative things and the pleasures
of life are not to be neglected by either of you, whether it is about eating or making love.
Those governed by the planet of beauty need beauty almost instinctively.</p>

          <p class="article__text text-justify">Both Taurus and Scorpio have a strong will, determination and enthusiasm. Neither
of you is indifferent to what’s going on around him/her. When you met your Scorpio,
you were probably fascinated. You noticed qualities that you’d like to have. Scorpio is so
charming that I completely understand you!</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">There are some superb similarities between you two, but also some differences that make
you almost opposite to each other. This Water native is mysterious, emotive, sentimental,
but at the same time introvert: it’ll be hard to get into Scorpio’s soul. To him/her, revealing
him/herself to someone is like committing him/herself. And before doing that, Scorpio
has to be certain it is worth it.</p>

          <p class="article__text text-justify">Have you fallen in love with a Taurus? Do you happen to like stability? Taurus is very different
from you: (s)he keeps his/her feet on the ground, (s)he likes safety, risks scare him/
her to death, change is an earthquake to him/her. Not to say that Taurus does not have
your strong nerves and this could lead to many conflicts!</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">The main disadvantage for an Aries in getting involved with a Taurus lies in the fact that
(s)he is really, really slow in everything (s)he does. Not in the bad meaning of the word,
only Taurus is more prudent, more difficult to start, more sensual when making love, or
slower in making decisions. I don’t have to tell you how much this thing will annoy you,
because Aries lives and moves at top speed. I think you are already guessing.</p>

          <p class="article__text text-justify">Each sign of the zodiac has the qualities that the preceding sign lacks... Gemini is right
after Taurus so they aren’t very careful when they throw themselves into a project, don’t
count ten times before cutting (in fact, they don’t even count) and they know that dreams
and occasions disappear when you take too much time to decide... The Gemini native
takes risks, is sharp-minded, witty in conversations, very versatile and changing and has a
unique gift for communication! Gemini is the best at it... You need roots though, considered
risks, safe methods and caution in everything.</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Gemini can live in a suitcase, that’s how much (s)he feels the need to travel, to walk, to go
to friends’ houses, exhibitions, dinner-parties, anywhere, but not home. And this is exactly
what you want most: to be able to stay at home, next to someone, in a comfortable home
away from the crazy world.</p>

          <p class="article__text text-justify">If you have your eyes set on a Libra, I probably don’t have to tell you how much (s)he likes
talking, and talking, and talking... About anything: philosophy, psychology or the price of
strawberries in comparison to the one of onions. You have a strong, rational mind, but at
one point you’ll start wondering if it’s really necessary to talk about all this when you are
tired from work and all you want is to sit dowdown in your armchair and relax while reading
the newspaper (Taurus is addicted to habits).</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">Libra is an Air sign, (s)he has to travel, at least in his/her mind; if (s)he can’t wander, (s)he
has to talk in compensation! Libra’s avid mind needs new topics all the time, new “tests”,
intellectual nourishment.</p>

work hard to stay by a Sagittarius’ side, and especially to make such a Jupiter native stay by
your side! Everything is so different with you two...</p>
          <p class="article__text text-justify">You’ll find out that Sagittarius is full of energy and optimism. And (s)he will regard your
caution as a sign of pessimism... Sagittarius likes living life to the full and especially traveling,
while you, dear Taurus, like habits, arranged and well-planned things, and the idea of
packing and wandering seven years in Tibet doesn’t sound too good to you...</p>

a solid base, love proofs, while Leo needs to be in the centre of attention (that is outside
home), to be applauded and first of all respected. Leo will fall in love with the compliments
Taurus is a master of, and (s)he’ll always ask for more... because Leo needs to know
(s)he’s at the top of the list, number one. And you won’t realize that you have to tell him/
her all over again how wonderful (s)he is, how beautiful and smart, how generous ((s)he

          <p class="article__text text-justify">They say Aquarius’ role on Earth is to break the existing structures and replace them with
better ones. And a Taurus is very terrified when (s)he hears these two words (“structure”
and “break”) in the same sentence. Taurus is into stability, fixed things, and (s)he can
hardly decide to get rid of his/her old pair of shoes, let alone change the world! Why not
keep what we have?, asks Taurus, and Aquarius starts telling him/her about the new technologies
that will revolutionize the world!</p>
